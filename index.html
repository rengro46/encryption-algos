<font face="Liberation Sans, sans-serif"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><u>Validation
of encryption algos in use:</u></font></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This project was initiated by receiving
a Security Directive from the office of CISO to ensure that all
encryption algo's being used in the organisation are secure and have
a key-length of at least 256 bits. The directive was focused on
addressing three specific security areas of concern for the
business:<br/>
- Checking the current set of communication encryption
algorithms in use (Data in Transit)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">- Checking the<br/>
 a. encryption
status of disk volumes (Data at Rest)<br/>
 b. encryption algo's used
for disk encryption<br/>
- Checking the key lengths of the SSL Web
certificates in use<br/>
<br/>
No scope of work/assessment of current
state of the business was received from CISO to point towards
specific areas to go remediate, only a blanket statement to review
all encryption algo's in use, therefore I separated the project into
two phases being:<br/>
- Current State Assessement<br/>
-
Remediation<br/>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Identify </b><b>Assets associated
with insecure </b><b>communication </b><b>encryption protocols in
use:</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Due to a number of legacy Operating
systems existing in the environment (Windows 2012, CentOs6.x, Ubuntu
12,14,16 and 18, Debian 8) still in use throughout the organisation,
it was decided to check for the existance of depracated encryption
protocols including:<br/>
- SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0 and <br/>
- TLS 1.0
and TLS 1.1<br/>
 <br/>
Using tools like NMAP and SSLSCan in a
limited scope evironment identified for a POC, a detailed
understanding of how to enumerate and interrogate ports using
encryted communication was achieved. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This investigation helped with the
identification of all of the QID's associated with SSL1, SSL2, SSL3,
TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 In addition, a list of encryption protocols,
already deemed insecure by the Security industry was compiled, and
QID's associated with each of these depracated encryption algo's were
identified and appended to the initial list of QID's identified for
insecure transport protocols. <br/>
<br/>
Using the complete list of
QID's identified, a custom asset report was created in Qualys Asset
module, to extract a list of assets with any of the associated QID’s
identified. The resulting asset report was then used as the basis for
the remediation plan to address those items found lacking ito secure
communication protocols, insecure encryption algo’s and the
directive received from CISO.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Identify </b><b>Assets associated
with insecure </b><b>disk </b><b>encryption protocols in use:</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The encryption status of disks across
the organisation was approached in a simple categorisation method. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">All server disks on premise were
interrogated with a script based approach, including Powershell for
Windows based servers, and python for Linux based server platforms. A
number of challenges were experienced, some around the specifics of
python regarding the linux distributions but mainly around firewall
access to specific systems. Once this was resolved, the disk
encryption status results were written into a database, with the
intent of using the database for analysis and reporting. The
extraction of all cloud based disk partition encryption status (incl.
Azure and AWS) was done using their respective CLI’s, with results
written to same database as used for on-prem data disks info</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A summary report was compiled to
portray the full picture of the entire organisation’s disk
encryption status, and subsequently published to a WEB page. 
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Identify Assets associated with
insecure </b><b>SSL certificates </b><b>in use:</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Collection of information regarding SSL
certificate in use for on-prem servers, was done using a combination
of Qualys Certificate Store, New Qualys Agents Scans and Qualys
Network scan results, some python scripts and some Powershell scripts
to extract info from windows server registry entries.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Extraction of Cloud based certificate
info included Azure Entra, Powershell scripts, Azure Key Vault, AWS
Certificate Manager, Qualys Certificate Store and Python scripts for
3<sup>rd</sup> party certificates, results were written to the
previously created database. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A custom report was created to:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">- Show disk volumes which did not have
encryption enabled and</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">- Those disk volumes using insecure
encryption algo’s already identified previously</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This report was published to the same
website as used previously for the comms protocol info. The entire
process to collect, collate and publish this comms, diskand
certificate encryption information was automated and implemented as a
live data report for use by the organisations Information Security
Manager as well as the Regional Information Security Officer going
forward.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"> 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This concluded the
assessment/investigation phase.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><u><b>Remediation</b></u></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Once the assessment info was published
and shared with the operational teams responsible for supporting and
updating these platforms, the Remediation initiative was kicked off. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A detailed extract of all server
information, including operating systems and versions was provided to
each of the technical engineering teams to review and provide
feedback. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Upon receiving feedback it became clear
that all of the platforms still running End of Life operating systems
were constrained by the legacy applications hosted on those systems.
A Large number of application owners were contacted and a process was
started to either sunset, redevelop or re-host the current set of
legacy applications. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Those applications for which the owners
could not be found was escalated to the Regional CIO for a decision
on how to proceed. An evaluation was made by the regional CIO of the
usage of these legacy apps for which owners could not be found.
Around 20 of the 25 apps for which owners could not be found were
deemed unsuitable for future use and were retired via a Change
management process. The other 5, for which the code was still
available in the organisational code repo was earmarked for being
migrated/replatformed into docker containers</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The remaining 67 legacy applications
were earmarked for either redevelopment, replatforming of retain
status, till their functionality could either be retired or
incorporated into one of the applications identified to be
redeveloped. This retain period was capped at a maximum of 6 months
from the date of decision. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">This remediation phase was intended to
be completed within 10 months in total, some external factors caused
some delays, and was eventually signed off by Exco as complete after
a periond of 12 months.
